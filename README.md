I mostly built it because I just want a macropad laying around for macros and etc, that was my inspiration

## Challenges
For my challenges, I didn’t use Fusion 360 or KiCad at all before. In KiCad I got the hang of it pretty quick, but for Fusion 360 not so much.
I googled so much and I personally think that it's a stupid piece of software, but I'm pretty proud of my self and my HackPad. The most difficult part for me was probably designing the case because as I mentioned before Fusion 360 is a stupid piece of software.
